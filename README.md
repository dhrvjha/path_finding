# Path Finding Visualizer

## What is Path Finding Visualizer?
It is demonstration of how different algorithms work on graph to find a path between two points or nodes.
In this project, we need to find path between start (Red) and end (Green) node.

## How?
Using HTML, CSS and of-course Java-script.

When [page](https://dhrvjha.github.io/path_finding/ "path finding site") is loaded a graph is drawn of small squares
we need to find path in this graph to meet end point.

## Challenges?
Algorithms are the starting challenges, later comes the designing of the program.
Making heap data structure was also a big challenge.
Goal was to make program Object-Oriented following Java-script conventions.


## Algorithms
- [x] Depth First Search
- [x] Breath First Search
- [ ] A-start algorithm
- [ ] Dijkstra's algorithm

## Contributions
All the contributions will be welcomed unless it changes the sole purpose of the project.
